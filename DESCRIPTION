Description: Implements Meng's data defect index (ddi), which represents
    the degree of sample bias relative to an iid sample. The data defect 
    correlation (ddc) represents the correlation between the outcome of interest
    and the selection into the sample; when the sample selection is independent
    across the population, the ddc is zero. Details are in Meng (2018)

    Law of Large Populations, Big Data Paradox, and the 2016 US Presidential 
    Election." Survey estimates from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study 
    (CCES) is included to replicate the article's results.
